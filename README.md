We are trying to create a model, that predicts tyre degradation as well as give the suggested tyre strategy which is race specific. Along with that we are also training a model that preditcts race winners based on the starting grid, quali performance, performance run data ir tyre deg data as an input, and drivers past statistics on that track.
!. Data gathering - We tried Fastf1 initially, but due to its api limit seta t 500/h, its was not viable as the data we are using exceeds this limit by far. So after a bit of research, we used openF1 to gather the data, which was much more effective and with it's api rate at 10/s was much more usefull.
2. Data preprocessing -  during the initial run to preprocess data, almost half of this data was discarded because of missing values in the data. We tried 3 methods - 
a) global median -  takes the gloabl average and fills in the missing value space, which is not viable as different drivers generate vastly different data, and also the car matters. 
b) Time - series Interpolation - fills the gap by drawing a straight line between the last known value and the next known value. e.g., Lap 4 temp is 25°C, Lap 6 is 26°C, it fills Lap 5 with 25.5°C. This is usefull for data that changes smoothly and logically, like air_temperature or track_temperature, but is terrible for performance runs. 
So finally we settled for group median , which takes the median within the group, here the group determining factors are session_id ie fp1/sprint quali, etc. and driver number , eg - 44 for Lewis Hamilton 🐐.
